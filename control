Package: geany-plugin-addons
Enhances: geany
Architecture: any
Depends: ${geany:ABI}, geany-plugins-common (= ${source:Version}),
         ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: miscellanous plugins for Geany
 This plugin adds various small addons to Geany which aren't worth an
 individual plugin, but might still be useful for people.
  * DocList: This addon places a new item in the toolbar and when clicked
    offers a menu listing all open files plus the 'Close All' and 'Close Other
    Documents' menu items. This can be useful to quickly access open files and
    switch to them.
  * OpenURI: Adds 'Open URI' and 'Copy URI' menu items to the editor menu when
    the word under the cursor looks like a URI. 'Open URI' uses the browser
    command configured in Geany to open it.
  * Tasks: The tasks plugin goes through a file being edited and picks out
    lines with "TODO" or "FIXME" in them. It collects the text after those words
    and puts them in a new "Tasks" tab in the message window. Clicking on a task
    in that tab takes you to the line in the file where the task was defined.
  * Systray: Adds a status icon to the notification area (systray) and
    provides a simple popup menu with some basic actions. It can also be used
    to quickly show and hide the Geany main window.

Package: geany-plugin-autoclose
Enhances: geany
Architecture: any
Depends: ${geany:ABI}, geany-plugins-common (= ${source:Version}),
         ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: auto-closing plugin for Geany
 This plugin enables auto-closing features. Auto-closing works while you typing
 and intellectually helps you to write code.
 .
 Features:
  * auto-close for: { }, [ ], ( ), " ", ' ', < >, ` `
  * customizeable auto-closing inside strings and comments
  * delete pairing character if you pressed BackSpace
  * suppress inserting one char twice (if you type "{}" you will get "{}", not
    "{}}")
  * enclose selected text into brackets instead of removing selection (select
    text and type "(" or ")" to enclose selection into "()")
  * keep selection when enclosing
  * for C-like languages enclosing selection into "{}" makes auto-indentation
    (select text and type "{" or "}" - text will be enclosed and indented)
  * enclosing in {} moves cursor to beginning (before "{" character)
  * for C-like languages to insert {}-block you do not need to select text
    precisely: plugin detects boundaries automatically, just ensure that
    selection covers lines you need to indent (works like TAB indentation)
  * fix auto-indent inside {} (makes full indent for this block)
  * auto-close curly bracket by pressing Enter
  * auto-close functions (``"sin(|" -> "sin(|);"``) with doubling suppression
    (for C/C++ languages only)
  * remove paring brace when pressing Shift+BackSpace, unindent {}-blocks
  * add semicolon after ``struct {|};`` and ``class {|};``
  * move cursor to closed char by pressing Tab

Architecture: any

         exuberant-ctags,
         ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: ctags plugin for Geany
 GeanyCtags adds a simple support for generating and querying ctags files
 for a Geany project.
 .
 Even though Geany supports symbol definition searching by itself within the
 open files (and with a plugin support within the whole project), tag
 regeneration can become too slow for really big projects. This is why this
 plugin was created. It makes it possible to generate the tag file only once
 and just query it when searching for a particular symbol
 definition/declaration. This approach is fine for big projects where most
 of the codebase remains unchanged and the tag positions remain more or
 less static.

    simply switch to that console and work directly with gdb.
